Instructions for setting up an exe for the application and for creating an installer 

[NOTE: this project works stable only on windows now ,for porting code base must be changed]

PREREQUISITES
#1 pyinstaller (for compiling .py files into .exe)
	get pyinstaller via pip (make sure python is in path to avoid all sorts of headaches later on)

	On cmd as admin run : pip install pyinstaller

#2 NSIS (used for making the installer to package resources along with the exe)

	download nsis from https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download

INSTRUCTIONS

Open cmd in working dir
type in : pyinstaller --onefile -w --icon=Budget_Planner.ico main.py

after the cmd process is completed ,
delete build and main.spec from project dir
move main.exe from dist folder to the project folder (to let the main.exe access the Databases folder and other resources if any like it usually does)

now delete dist folder

rename main.exe as Budget_Planner.exe

_____________________________________________________________
#Packaging project dir to a NSIS installer

copy the nsi file in the Installer Setup Folder to the project dir
run the nsi script in project dir (compile using nsis)
