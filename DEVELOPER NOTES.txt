These are additional notes for the developers


[NOTES / INSTRUCTIONS]

#1 When making the installer or exe for experimental purpose , remember to not include them while adding to commit (just delete the installer and exe , or move them to somewhere else ) . Since the .exe is aout 30Mb and , its something u can compile from any system if u have the source code . So yeah dont add those .exe files to commit . [But if this is the final release or close to that , u can build the exe and add them to commit]

#2 For now this application is not cross platform , it works on windows only . But with some minor changes in code , maybe we can port it for mac and linux . But thats for later

#3 Also when u run the code a _pycache_ folder is created . Just delete that folder . its just useless . Dont add it to commit

#4 Clean code in main.py , organise in order of events happen and windows where buttons or functions are used , order of priority will be 1. General functions and buttons 2. first window(profile choose) 3. second window (edit screen) ... etc







[BUGS]

#1







[SUGGESTIONS / FEATURES to implement]

below for now are a few additional capabilities i would like to add to the project if time allows us . But this is left to anyone who works on the code right now



#1 A delete profile and edit profile button

so this button will be in the main window , as well as the window in which u land when u choose the profile

the edit profile button will open the same text editing window , but there will be two modes like there will be a global variable saying creaation/edit state and state 1 will launch the line edit page in creation mode and state 2 will launch the edit page in edit mode . (after edit it should go to the window which u land when u choose the profile , and load the new db file [the renamed one])

The delete button would just delete the db file , and restart the application

#2 A back button

So this will be in the edit window and in the main profile window to the top leftish . it would return u to the main screen
