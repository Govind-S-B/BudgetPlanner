So I have been planning on adding a few more additions , but for now i have cut em off from the main program , if we get excess time, maybe we can add them in

#1 Appdrawer buttons to switch profile 

so clicking on the small button , should load the corresponding database in the first screen (user profile selection)

This can be implemented by using the buttongroup object

self.btn_grp = QButtonGroup() <- add this before calling the button constructor 
self.btn_grp.setExclusive(True)

self.btn_grp.addButton(self.button1) <-add this to button constructor function

self.btn_grp.buttonClicked.connect(self.on_click) <- add this to init

def self.on_click():
	previous index = index
	index = self.btn_grp.checkedId()
	setindex() #this is the index update function that we have already made

#2 A delete profile and edit profile button

so this button will be in the main window , as well as the window in which u land when u choose the profile 

the edit profile button will open the same text editing window , but there will be two modes like there will be a global variable saying creaation/edit state and state 1 will launch the line edit page in creation mode and state 2 will launch the edit page in edit mode . (after edit it should go to the window which u land when u choose the profile , and load the new db file [the renamed one])

The delete button would just delete the db file , and restart the application

#3 A back button 

So this will be in the edit window and in the main profile window to the top leftish . it would return u to the main screen 

#4 a restart button along with the min max and close button

cause ya know there is a f5 shortcut for restart already , so having a restart button wont hurt ig ?
